                As a final research project for high-school, did I create a robot with an Arduino, gyroscope and accelerometer.
                The end result was a robot that drove in a straight line, and corrected itself when
                it slipped or otherwise just drifted off course. It worked by feeding the
                measurements from the sensors into a PID which calculated adjustments in motor
                speed to get the robot back in the correct course

                A school project with 6 students where wrote a Reddit like social media platfrom in ASP.net.

            <div class="card-title">The Loop Programming Language</div>
            <div class="card-subtitle">September 2021 - Ongoing</div>
            <div class="card-body">
                Creating a Just-In-Time compiled programming language called Loop. Syntax and semantics is similar to something like GoLang and Python.
                The Language is implemented in Rust and the compilation target currently is LuaJIT.

            <div class="card-body">
                During the development of the project we worked with a lot of people with different specialisations:
                media design, infrastructure, software engineering, to name a few.
